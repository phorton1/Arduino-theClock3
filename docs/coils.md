Although you can *probably* wind these coils by hand, I have now
made several dozen such coils and, to facilitate the process, I made a quick and
[**coil winding machine**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-CoilWindingMachine)
that is laser cut from the same *cheap plywood* I use for this clock.
Please follow the above link to the repository for the **Fusion 360 design**,
**DXF Files** and the Arduino Nano **INO Sketch** for that machine.


**Next:** Creating the [**Electronics**](electronics.md) for the clock ...
